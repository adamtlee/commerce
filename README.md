# Commerce

Commerce is a modern, open-source headless e-commerce platform designed for developers who want full control and flexibility. Built on a modular, API-first architecture, it provides a powerful backend for managing products, carts, and orders, allowing you to build a custom storefront using any frontend framework (e.g., React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte). 

Unlike monolithic platforms such as Shopify, Commerce gives you the freedom to create unique, high-performance shopping experiences without being locked into a proprietary system.

## ‚ú®Features
- Headless & API-First: A clean separation of the backend logic from the frontend presentation layer. Use our robust REST API to power your storefront.
- Product Management: Create, update, and manage products with variants, custom attributes, and rich media.
- Shopping Cart: A flexible cart system that handles adding, updating, and removing items, along with calculations for subtotals, totals, and taxes.
- Secure Checkout: Streamlined and secure checkout process with built-in support for popular payment gateways.
- Order Management: Comprehensive order tracking, fulfillment, and history, accessible through the admin dashboard and API.
- Inventory Management: Track stock levels, manage availability, and handle out-of-stock scenarios.
- Localization: Support for multiple currencies and languages to build global stores.
- Extensible: A modular architecture that allows you to integrate with other services (CMS, payment gateways, shipping providers) and build custom logic.
- Developer-Friendly: Built with modern web technologies, offering an intuitive SDK and clear documentation.
